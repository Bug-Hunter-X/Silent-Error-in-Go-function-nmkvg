# Silent Error in Go Function

This example demonstrates a common error in Go: neglecting to check for errors returned by functions.  The `myFunc` function returns an error if the input `a` is zero, but the `main` function's error handling is incomplete. This can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures.

## Bug

The bug lies in the `main` function.  It calls `myFunc`, but only prints the error if one occurs.  If `myFunc` returns an error, the error message is correctly printed. However, no action is taken on the error; the program continues execution without utilizing the returned error.  This can lead to unexpected outputs or issues if the function's return values are used further in the program.

## Solution

The solution involves properly handling the error.  If the error is `nil`, we process the `result`, otherwise, we handle the error in a way that is appropriate for the application (e.g., logging, error message, termination).
